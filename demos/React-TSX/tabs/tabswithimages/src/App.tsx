        in London's main financial district, the City of London, completed in December 2003
        and opened at the end of May 2004. With 40 floors, the tower is 180 metres (591
        ft) tall, and stands on the former site of the Baltic Exchange building, which was
        severely damaged on 10 April 1992 by the explosion of a bomb placed by the Provisional
        IRA.`,
        text: `The building is on the former site of the Baltic Exchange building, the headquarters
        of a global marketplace for ship sales and shipping information. On 10 April 1992
        the Provisional IRA detonated a bomb close to the Exchange, severely damaging the
        historic Exchange building and neighbouring structures. The UK government's statutory
        adviser on the historic environment, English Heritage, and the City of London governing
        body, the City of London Corporation, were keen that any redevelopment must restore
        the building's old fa√ßade onto St Mary Axe. The Exchange Hall was a celebrated fixture
        of the ship trading company.`,

        island 280 m (920 ft) out from Jumeirah beach, and is connected to the mainland
        by a private curving bridge. It is an iconic structure whose shape mimics the sail

        previously called Chicago Beach. The hotel is located on an island of reclaimed
        land 280 meters offshore of the beach of the former Chicago Beach Hotel. The locale's
        name had its origins in the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company which at one time welded
        giant floating oil storage tankers on the site. The old name persisted after the
        old Hotel was demolished in 1997. Dubai Chicago Beach Hotel remained as the Public
        Project Name for the construction phase of Burj Al Arab Hotel until Sheikh Mohammed
        bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced the new name.`,

        towers in New York, and it held this rank for nearly 25 years. The Willis Tower
