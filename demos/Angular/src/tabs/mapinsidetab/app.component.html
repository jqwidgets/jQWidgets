    The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of
    Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza Necropolis bordering
    what is now El Giza, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
    World, and the only one to remain largely intact.
