        ReactJS File Upload demo. jqxFileUpload can be used for uploading file(s) to a server. In this demo you can browse for files and click the widget's buttons to see how it will work in a real environment. For uploading files however, you should set the "uploadUrl" property to point to a Web Server file that will handle the actual Upload process.
