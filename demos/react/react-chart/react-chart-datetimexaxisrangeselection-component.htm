        This is an example of React Chart range selector and zooming. The chart data is prepared from a csv file. You can see an example of a complex tool tip custom formatting with the toolTipCustomFormatFn function. You can also see how to limit the duration of the animation with the animationDuration setting. The code also demonstrates how to render the selector in a separate container.
